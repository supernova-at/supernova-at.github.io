			<h2>What is Candy?</h2>
			<p>I totally backronymed CANDY to stand for the following:
				<br/><br/>
				<span class="firstLetter">C</span>ode<br/>
				<span class="firstLetter">A</span>lgorithms<br/>
				<span class="firstLetter">N</span>icely<br/>
				<span class="firstLetter">D</span>o<br/>
				<span class="firstLetter">Y</span>ou</br>
				<br/>
				Say it like this guy and it should make more sense:

			<h2>Why is Candy?</h2>
			<p>
				Well, my new job has me excited about coding again and I want to share that with you!
				<br/><br/>
				Every other week we pick a new coding problem to solve together.  For maximum learnings, we give everyone a week to write their own solution for it in whatever language they want, then we post our solutions to the group.  For the next week, we'll all talk about what we liked from other people's solutions, and how we can improve them - whether that's readability, patterns, efficiency, etc. etc.
				<br/><br/>
				There is a wide swath of talent levels in the group (from wide-eyed beginner to grisly veteran) and I hope that this is a learning experience for everyone, improving your own code and helping other people improve theirs.

			<h2>How to Eat your Candy</h2>
			<p>
				Use your preferred language / editor to finish your candy.
				<br/><br/>
				If you don't have an IDE, try out these free online editors for your language of choice:
				<ul>
					<li><span class="bold">C#:</span>&nbsp;<a href="http://csharppad.com">C# Pad</a></li>
					<li><span class="bold">Javascript:</span>&nbsp;<a href="http://codepen.io/">CodePen</a> or <a href="http://jsfiddle.net">JSFiddle</a></li>
					<li><span class="bold">Pretty much everything else:</span>&nbsp;<a href="https://ideone.com/">Ideone</a></li>
				</ul>
				<span class="bold">Learn to Share:</span>
				<br/><br/>
				Head on over to <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> and create yourself an account if you don't already have one. Gist is one of the easiest ways to share code online, so we'll be using that.
				<br/><br/>
				To create a Gist, follow these steps:
				<ol>
					<li>Go to <a href="https://gist.github.com/">Gist</a></li>
					<li>Give your Gist a description and filename (with extension to enable syntax highlighting)</li>
					<li>Copy your solution into the Gist</li>
					<li>Click "Create Secret Gist" button (or make it public if you really want to)</li>
				</ol>
				<span class="bold">Finish your Candy:</span>
				<br/><br/>
				You have a week to finish your candy and share it with the group. At that time, everyone is encouraged to look over the other solutions and provide feedback directly to the author on their Gist.
				<br/><br/>
				We also kick off a general discussion where we can talk about more overarching things that don't really fit as a response to a specific Gist. (To be perfectly honest I'm not quite sure the best format for this part yet so we'll likely play it by ear)
				<br/><br/>
				<span class="bold">Grabbing the Extras:</span>
				A couple things to keep in mind:
				<ol>
					<li>Not everyone is programming in your language!  Please provide comments to help those of us who can't read convoluted-ass Objective-C code ;)   It's also good practice to comment everything anyway</li>
					<li>Be nice.  We're all here to learn and have fun.  Help others improve but don't be a jerk. Legit, I'll kick bitches out for this one</li>
				</ol>
