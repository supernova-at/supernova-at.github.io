		<h1>Candy Week 2: Tic Tacs Toe</h1>

		<section>
			<h2>Second Helpings</h2>
			<p>Hello and welcome back to Candy!</p>
			<p>I thought everyone did a great job last week with Fizz Buzz Bang - I hope you all enjoyed it!</p>

			<h2>Adding pieces to the Jar</h2>
			<p>We have a new participant this week and instead of going over everything again with every new member I thought it'd be easier to set up a site to point to. ALL HAIL THE <a href="../index.html">CANDY WEBSITE</a>.</p>
			<p>It should look familiar to you all because I pretty much straight copied it out of the original set of emails.  I also spent a TON of time on it, which should be clearly evident. I do want to point out, however, that we now have a theme song!  And as much as you're all hoping it's a remix of Paul's vocals from Fizz Buzz Bang, sadly it is not.  Although, now that I think about it, that would be awesome and we should probably do that instead.</p>
			<p>ANYWAY, the song is (predictably) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMICD3aMZpw">I want Candy</a>. So, you know, that's kinda cool.</p>

			<h2>This Week's Candy</h2>
			<p>This week's Candy, should you choose to eat it, is Tic Tacs Toe!</p>

			<h3>Here is the problem statement:</h3>
			<p>You are given a string of nine (9) characters, representing a game of Tic Tac Toe.  Write an algorithm to evaluate the board.  The possible outcomes are:
				<ul>
					<li>X wins</li>
					<li>O wins</li>
					<li>Tie Game</li>
					<li>Game still in progress</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<h4>Mapping input to Tic Tac Toe board</h4>
			<p>Each character in your input represents a space on a Tic Tac Toe board.  The mapping is as follows (by index):</p>
			<figure>
				<img src="../images/mapping.jpg" alt="Mapping" height="200" width="200">

			</figure>
			<h4>The Characters</h4>
			<p>Your input string will consist of the following characters:
				<ul>
					<li>x = Player X occupies this space</li>
					<li>o = Player O occupies this space</li>
					<li>- = No player occupies this space</li>
				</ul>
				So for example, your inputs will look like: &quot;--xxoo---&quot;. And that would map to the following Tic Tac Toe board:
				<figure>
					<img src="../images/example.jpg" alt="Example Mapping" height="200" width="200">
					<figcaption>Those were some terrible moves</figcaption>
				</figure>
				For the purposes of this exercise, you don't have to validate your input.  You can assume that it will always be nine (9) characters, and that it will only contain some combination of the &quot;x&quot;, &quot;o&quot;, and &quot;-&quot; characters.
			</p>
			<h4>Sample Inputs &amp; Outputs</h4>
			<p>To help test your program, here are some sample inputs and what your program should output:</p>
			<table>
				<thead>
					<tr>
						<th>Input</th>
						<th>Output</th>						
					</tr>
				</thead>
				<tr>
					<td>xxx-o-o-o</td>
					<td>X wins</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>xo-ox-o-x</td>
					<td>X wins</td>
				</tr>				
				<tr>
					<td>x-o-o-oxx</td>
					<td>O wins</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>x-xooo-x-</td>
					<td>O wins</td>
				</tr>				
				<tr>
					<td>ooxxxooxx</td>
					<td>Tie Game</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>oxooxoxox</td>
					<td>Tie Game</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>---------</td>
					<td>In Progress</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>xox---oxo</td>
					<td>In Progress</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
